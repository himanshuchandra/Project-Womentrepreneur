# Project-Womentrepreneur
This is my team project which we made in a Hackathon at GTBIT(under GGSIPU). 
This is basically a website to support Women Entrepreneurship.In today's world women are doing really great in different fields but most of the womans are unaware of this fact.They don't know what other successful womans are doing in industry?, how they start their own company? and so on.To help women understanding this fact easily, we made this.
This website gives all information about leading women in entrepreneurship so that other womans can take this as an inspiration and take a step in the field of Entrepreneurship.
